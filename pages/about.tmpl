					<h3>Simple and focused</h3>
					<p>Write.as isn't a platform for building <em>any</em> kind of blog or website. It's meant to help you get your thoughts down&mdash;and published&mdash;fast.</p>

					<h3>Distraction-free</h3>
					<p>Our editor lets you write and publish &mdash; that's it. And we separated the <a href="https://read.write.as">reading</a> experience so there's no stream or feed or "likes" or "follows" to steal your focus.</p>

					<h3>Never lose your progress</h3>
					<p>Your writing automatically saves as you type. It'll always be waiting, even if you don't "save" before leaving.</p>
