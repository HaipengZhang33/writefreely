We're building a small, focused digital writing and publishing tool that you can host yourself. Today, you can see what will eventually be open source on [Write.as](https://write.as) &mdash; and see our complementary reader that's already open source today, called [Read.as](https://github.com/writeas/Read.as).

## Development

**This product doesn't exist in its open-source form yet**. Today it's a hosted platform (with some open source components and clients) serving thousands of blogs on [Write.as](https://write.as). Still, you can _star_ this repo now and get updates on GitHub as we start building it.

Nothing presented here is final, including the name, roadmap, and features of the product -- but you can get a pretty good idea of what will come based on our goals below and the product that already exists as a hosted solution today.

## Goals

These are our product goals unique to the open source version of Write.as, and stand in addition to the simple, pared-down platform we've already built.

* Painless install (single executable, no dependencies, no Docker or external database required)
* Lightweight enough to host on a cheap VPS with no more than 256MB of memory
* Single- and multi-blog hosting
* Capable of federating with other instances

## Features

* Start a blog for yourself, or host a community of writers
* Form larger federated networks, and interact over modern protocols like ActivityPub
* Syndicate your content to silos like Twitter, Medium, Tumblr, and more as we add them
* Build more advanced things with the built-in API
* Write from anywhere with our cross-platform apps, browser extension, and command-line client -- or bring your own Micropub-enabled client

## Contributing

We'd love to have your help building this platform in the open. If you're interested, [get in touch](https://write.as/contact) or just [keep up with us on Slack](http://slack.write.as).
