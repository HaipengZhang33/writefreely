# Building

* Run `npm install` to download dependencies.
* Run `npm run-script build` to build a production script in `../static/js/` or run
`npm run develop` to build and watch for changes. You can use `prose.html`
to test your development changes.
* Manually copy the file `prose.bundle.js` to `static/js/`. _To be automated_
